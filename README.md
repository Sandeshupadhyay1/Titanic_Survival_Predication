# Titanic_Survival_Predication
In this blog-post, I will go through the whole process of creating a machine learning model on the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival.

I initially wrote this post on kaggle.com, as part of the “Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster” Competition. In this challenge, we are asked to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.
